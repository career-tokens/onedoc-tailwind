# Currently this repo contains the code for three templates (individual code can be found in templates folder) 
### First install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

### Run the app to generate the default template(Brochure):
```
npm run dev
```
### Then get your one doc api key and then create a .env file where assign the value to ONEDOC_API_KEY.

### To switch templates, go to route.ts and simply replace Brochure()with either CV() or Payroll() (they are already imported)

### Below are the pdfs attached:
